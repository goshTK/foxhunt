Fox hunting game in Tcl/Tk

This is a simple game with finding objects on the playing field. Implementation on Tcl / Tk.
Pressing the left mouse button on the cell of the playing field shows how many "foxes" are visible from this cell (vertically, horizontally and diagonally). If the cell turns red, you have found a "fox."
Pressing the middle mouse button highlights the horizontal, vertical and diagonals.

Pressing the right button marks the cells in sight.

After detecting all the "foxes", a message appears indicating the completion of the game.
